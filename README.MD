# Kinect Calibration Tools

This repository includes a few tools you may find useful while working with a Kinect, especially if you plan to use it in conjuction with a Baxter Robot. 

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| baxter\_frame\_calibration | Includes files necessary to correctly attach Freenect ROS driver frames to a Baxter robot. |
| emarolab\_kinect\_driver | Includes some samples of how we launch one or more Kinects from a remote machine. This is quite specific to our setup and even if you work in the Emarolab you most probably can ignore these files since everything has already been set up. |
| kinectA_calibration(spare) | Contains our latest calibration of the spare Kinect. |
| kinectB_calibration(baxter) | Contains our latest calibration of the Kinect mounted on the Baxter robot. |
