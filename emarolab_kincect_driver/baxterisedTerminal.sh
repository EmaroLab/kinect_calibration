script to baxterise the terminal by running ~/ros_wk/baxter.sh. Also, it may run the freenect KinectB driver attached to the ros core running on the Baxter.

where:
	-h  show this help text
	-f  if it is 0 the Kinect driver is not called. if it is 1 (Default) then the Kinect driver is called.
	-i  set the IP of the local machine to be exported in the ROS_IP variable (Default: 130.251.13.36).
	-m  set the ROS core uri which must be the same used by Baxter (Default: 130.251.13.31)
	-c  set the ROS workspace path (Default: ~/catkin_ws/).
	-b  set the script to Baxterise the terminal on the workspace [-c] (Default: baxter.sh)	
	-a  if it is 0 the terminal will not baxterised and [-c][-b] will not be used. if it is 1 (Default) yes
